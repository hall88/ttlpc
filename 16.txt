Dear ,

I am interested in pursueing a position at . I believe my experience developing a wireless education tool and building a computer at the micro-architectural level would make me a good fit for this position. I believe my experience developing these systems reflect core values of integrity and service. These projects include experience with SPICE simulators, C, Python, testing, and verification. Their documentation is available at:

I look forward to hearing back from you.

Thanks,
Kenneth Hall
